This module allows 2D or 3D simulations of blobs in a slab geometry with curvature

The model is gyro-bohm normalized (length scales normalized to rho_s, time normalized to Omega_i)

Sheath boundary conditions are implemented. To run in 2D set ny = 2 in the input file. 
To set parallel length scale use dy.
